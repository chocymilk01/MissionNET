# MissionNET
**Welcome to MissionNET Radio - Networking, Exploration, and Testing.**

This is a public blog to share with others my experiences of using professional radios for the amateur.

Content may expand over time, first documenting my experiences with the Motorola MOTOTRBO family of radios and DMR (Digital Mobile Radio).

### On Github
MissionNET can be found at: https://chocymilk01.github.io/MissionNET-radio/

Pull requests which offer 1). well-documented, 2). well-justified, and 3). well-referenced edits or additions *may* be entertained to contribute to the collective knowledge of using professional two-way radios in an amateur capacity.
